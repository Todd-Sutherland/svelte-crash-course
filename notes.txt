Reactivity in Svelte
*If you update a variable, it reflects onto the dom on your screen
*We've seen how we can add dynamic data/define your data in the script tag and use them in your HTML templates
*We're going to look at how we can update that data and then get it reflected onto the screen

1. assignment
    count = 10; 
svelte knows that this is updating the variable 'count'

2. update statements
    count ++;
    count += 2;
svelte knows that you are updating this variable 'count'

3. updating / assigning a property
    let obj = {count : 0}
    {obj.count}
svelte sees that you're updating the property of an object

Anyting outside of these 3, svelte will not know you're updating...for example
1. const data = obj;
    data.count ++;
